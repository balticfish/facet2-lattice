# Beam Stay Clear definitions
excel and matlab data stored for FACET2e, various Sector 20 configurations as labeled, 'master' file is max stay clear from all configuration files

Where required, energy spread and bunch length are taken from most demanding case studied (corresponding to 2-bunch PWFA config)

Data columns are:
* Beamline index and S coordinate from model. These data refer to the UPSTREAM face of each Beamline element
* Beam stay clear definitions are half-apertures in x (horizontal), y (vertical) and r (radius)
* "all" refers to overall stay clear- this is sum in quadrature of below
* "beta" refers to betatron aperture (10 * sqrt(emit*beta))
* "eta" refers to dispersive aperture (eta*de/E_max) + 10% safety margin
* "tcav" refers to streaked tcav image (R_(12 or 34) * upstream tcav kick * sigma_z
